Design process:
For the design I took elements related to space and contrasted them with very neutral warm tones to let the images be the protagonist of the interface. Same as the choice of typeface. Something really simple and with a "tech" look. Simple elements and shapes along with the concept of the polaroid snaps are the main elements of the concept in this design. It is thought in dark mode, resembling the universe.

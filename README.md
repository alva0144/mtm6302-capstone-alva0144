Design process:
For the design I took elements related to space and contrasted them with very neutral warm tones to let the images be the protagonist of the interface. Same as the choice of typeface. Something really simple and with a "tech" look. Simple elements and shapes along with the concept of the polaroid snaps are the main elements of the concept in this design. It is thought in dark mode, resembling the universe.



NASA API implementation:

For the implementation of the API I created a key in the https://api.nasa.gov/

- With this key I went to my javascript document and I created an event listener for the button that would generate the image. also, a declared a const for the date picker and assigned it to a value input in the html-

- After that, I linked the URL and created a fetch function to retrieve the data using a query selector for the img and the date and an get element by id to get the explanation. 

CHALLENGES:

I faced multiple challenges with the implementation of the design. trying to connect the generate button to another page was really hard and I had to change the design of the website to make it easier to code. The objective is to try to make a better development with more time availability.
